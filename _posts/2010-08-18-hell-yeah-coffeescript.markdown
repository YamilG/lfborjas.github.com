I've been hacking a little with node.js; and loving it. And even though JavaScript is sexy as it is, I always thought that it was like the C of the *new languages* : powerful, yet whimsy.

Cue [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/), Javascript's "*less ostentatious kid brother*". It's actually a language that *compiles* into javascript, and that's a nice idea: you can write clear, crisp and human readable code and *still* manage to get the most of even the most arcane of javascript idioms. 

Take for example this random piece of CoffeeScript code
<script src="http://gist.github.com/534136.js"> </script>

Which compiles into this javascript cutie:
<script src="http://gist.github.com/534141.js"> </script>
-I told you it was random

And, if you download now (or , you know, anytime) you get a command line interpreter for free! 

Give it a shot, and boost your javascript hacking, be it server or client side.
